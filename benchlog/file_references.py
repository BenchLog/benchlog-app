"""Rewrite `files/<path>` markdown link/image references when a file or
folder moves.

The renderer (`benchlog.markdown.rewrite_project_file_links`) falls back
to the files browser for broken `files/…` hrefs, so no rewrite leaves
readers on a 404 — but the author-written markdown still points at the
old path. When an owner renames a file or folder we patch the source
markdown so the reference itself stays truthful.

Only the author-facing `]( ... )` portion of link/image syntax is
touched. Fenced code blocks, tilde fences, HTML blocks, and inline code
spans are left alone so a `files/foo` literal inside a code sample isn't
mistaken for a live reference.

The masking strategy is a **line-scan + inline-code regex**, not a full
token walk:

* Block-level (fences, HTML blocks) are tracked by a small line-scanner
  that flips state on `^\`\`\``/`^~~~` (fenced) and paired HTML tags.
  markdown-it-py's token stream reports `map = [start_line, end_line]`
  for these too, but using line-indexed state here keeps the module a
  pure text-in/text-out helper with no dependency on the parser for
  correctness — the parser is only used to sanity-check the edge cases
  covered by tests.
* Inline code is masked per-prose-line with a balanced-backtick regex.
  This covers `` `files/foo` `` in the common case. CommonMark's
  n-backticks-open/n-backticks-close rule is nuanced (see
  https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#code-spans), but the approximation
  here matches every realistic reference in user content.

If you're extending this module for a new kind of rename, add a test in
`tests/test_file_references.py` for the edge case first — the masking
is intentionally conservative and breaking it silently would re-introduce
the problem this module was created to solve.
